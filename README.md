# SSH Log Analyzer

The SSH Log Analyzer is an simple Python utility designed for administrators to analyze SSH access attempts from `auth.log` files. The script extracts IP addresses, evaluates their frequency, and filters out those that are not from a specified country. This is particularly useful for identifying potential security threats and enforcing network security policies.
